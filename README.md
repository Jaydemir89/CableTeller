This is a tool that can be used by coaxial Cable technicians to determine the condition of a cable run.

It uses a low and high frequency reading from both ends of the run to determine whether or not the cable is passing 
appropriate signal, estimates distance in feet, and guesses whether or not there are splitters in the line.

Obviously the math is not perfect as many things can impact these readings (unseen damage to the cable, temperature, 
dielectric material, etc.) Results are to be taken as more of a suggestion than anything else. 

The interface is intentionally simplified so it can be used on a mobile device of any screen size, and so it can be used 
quickly without taking up too much time.
